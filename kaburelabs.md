### Data Scientist, Python Developer, Accountant and Data Platforms & Products Specialist


I'm an accountant and a full-stack Data Scientist; I'm used to develop data product (dashboards with ML / explanability, powerful NLP solutions with state-of-art results, and much more) as end-to-end engineer.  <br><br>

- Kaggle Notebooks Grandmaster (best ranked at 12th over more than 150k+ other data scientists, with 17 gold medals and 8 silver medals)
- Top Rated Plus on Upwork (It's a badge delivered only to 1% of the professionals on this platform)
