<h2 align="center">Hello there! My name is Stephen Ajulu. 👋🤓</h2>
<p align="center">I'm a Front End Web Developer, Graphic Designer, Content Creator and Junior Cybersecurity Consultant/Analyst from Kenya.

I currently passionate about JAMstack, Progressive Web Apps, Headless CMS, Nocode(the irony), Sustainability, Neural Nets, Hugo, S.E.O, Web Performance, Blogging/Vlogging/"Podgging"/Logging and Automation.
When I'm not developing and building things, you can find me on Youtube learning, writing an article, watching anime, daydreaming actionpacked dreams where i am the MC or on my laptop gaming.
