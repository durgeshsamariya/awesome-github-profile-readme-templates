# XML Makes Me Learn HTML

Hi there! My name is Vanza Setia. For over two years, I've been studying front-end web development.

## How Do You Start Learning about Web Development?

I started learning web development because of XML. At first, I didn't want to learn about web development. I wanted to hack a game. The game contains player data written in XML format. So, I decided to learn XML.

My goal in learning XML was if any other games used XML to store player data, I could understand the code and then change the data. But, it turns out that there were the very little amount of XML tutorials. Most of the tutorials were about HTML. As a result, I decided to watch the XML and HTML tutorials.

After I watched the HTML tutorial video, all of a sudden, I remembered something. I remembered wanting to build a website when I was a kid. The purpose of my website was to allow people to download modded or hacked games. So, I decided to learn about web development instead of hacking games.

## Tell Me a Little Bit about Yourself

I have been learning front-end web development for more than two years. I specialized in creating accessible websites. In the last year alone, I have completed more than 20 projects in Frontend Mentor. I also helped hundreds of people in the Frontend Mentor community by critically analyzing their code and giving them feedback. That's what I am passionate about.

My strength is my ability to create accessible websites. I pride myself on my reputation in the community creating responsive and accessible websites. Not only that, every time I have done creating the website, I spare my time to write `README` to explain the process of how I created the website. I want those people to learn from my mistakes and get something when they visit my repositories.
