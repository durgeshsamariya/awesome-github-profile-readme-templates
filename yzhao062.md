### Hi there, I'm [Yue ZHAO (赵越 in Chinese)!](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/) 👋


I am pursuing a [Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Public Policy (expected)](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/joint-phd-mlpp.html) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Additionally, I am a seasoned ML software/system architect with 7 Python machine learning libraries, ~8,000 GitHub stars, and >200,0000 total downloads.

**Good news: I am looking for 2021 Summer ML/DM Internship in Canada, United States, or China. Not necessarily pure research; system or AutoML related stuff would be great fit as well.** Just reach out and we could work something out :)

And of course, I am still a ML/DM researcher at the end of the day.

🔭 **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- data mining topics related to scalability, reliability, and automation and
- information systems questions related to interaction, trade-off, and cooperation between human and “AI”

😄 **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type) and 
- research internships (open for Summer 2021). I could legally work in Canada, United States, and China

💬 **News & Travel**:

- **Aug 2020**: Our paper [COPOD: Copula-Based Outlier Detection](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuezhao2/papers/20-icdm-copod-preprint.pdf) (original version) has been accepted by [ICDM 2020](http://icdm2020.bigke.org/)!
It is a **fast, parameter-free, and highly interpretable unsupervised outlier detection algorithm**.
The revised version and the integration to [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod) will be out soon. Nice work with [Zheng Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/winstonl) :)
- **Aug 2020**: [PyHealth](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyhealth) (a python library for Healthcare AI) is released!
