## üí° My Philosophy
I believe in a world where technology serves to **enhance creativity**, not replace it. My approach to software and art is about finding balance between efficiency and expression, all while pursuing **personal growth** through continuous learning and reflection.

> "You may not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. It is a creativity based on logic."
> Alfonso John Romero-

> Programming is the art that combines logic and mathematics with creativity. If it exists in your mind, you can create it. In programming, there are no limits. Don't let anyone stop you.
