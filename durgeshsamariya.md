### Hi there, I'm [Durgesh Samariya](https://durgeshsamariya.com) üëã

I am a third year Machine Learning Ph.D. candidate at [Federation University](https://federation.edu.au), Australia. Apart from that I am seasonal ML developer that loves writing articles (on Machine Learning, Data Science, Productivity and PhD Tips ) and contributing to open source.


- üíª Currently working on PyML, a python toolkit for building some of machine learning models and state-of-the-art algorithms without using any libraries. The aim of this project is to learn machine learning algorithms from scratch.
- üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Currently growing my skillset in [Machine Learning](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/100DaysofMachineLearning) and [Data Science](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/100DaysofDataScience).

**My Reseach Interest**:
- Classification
- Clustering
- Anomaly Detection
- Similarity Measure

 **I am open to**:

- any collobration work,
- machine learning projects(development or research),
- research internships and
- available to become reviewer or PC member for Machine Learning/Data mining journals or conferences.

**Recent Update**:
- **July 2020**: Our paper [A new effective and efficient measure for outlying aspect mining](http://wasp.cs.vu.nl/WISE2020/accept.html) has been accepted at the 21st International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering 2020 ([WISE 2020](http://wasp.cs.vu.nl/WISE2020/)).

**Service to research comunity**:
- PC Member, at The European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases 2020 ([ECML/PKDD 2020](https://ecmlpkdd2020.net/organisation/programcommittee/)), Ghent [2020].
